Electronic Components Classification: 

This project aims to classify various electronic components (ECs) using a deep learning model based on the InceptionV3 architecture. The model is trained to identify different types of electronic components from images. Database with labelled images of various ECs on PCBs can be found here:

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify electronic components based on PCBs from images. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it leverages the InceptionV3 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet.

## Features

- Classification of various electronic components.
- Use of transfer learning with InceptionV3.
- Customizable hyperparameters.
- Evaluation metrics including confusion matrix and classification report.
